"""Visual image inspection tool.

Flow (like a friend giving you a pendrive with downloaded photos):
1. Download ALL images from provided URLs at FULL RESOLUTION → save to output/candidate_images/
2. Show small 400px thumbnails as base64 so the agent can SEE each image visually
3. Agent selects the best one
4. create_post_image_gemini loads the full-res file from disk and sends it to Gemini

Keeps a URL→filepath manifest so create_post_image_gemini knows which file to load.

    Downloads every image at FULL RESOLUTION to disk (for Gemini later),
    then shows small 400px thumbnails so you can SEE each image with your vision.

    Evaluate each image you see:
    - **Cleanliness** (MOST IMPORTANT) — must be FREE of other outlet logos,
      chyrons, banners, or text overlays. REJECT any image with foreign branding.
    - **Relevance** — directly depicts the news story.
    - **Visual quality** — sharp, well-lit, professionally composed.
    - **Impact** — eye-catching on social media.

    After viewing all images, use think_tool to record:
    1. A 1-line assessment of each image (clean? relevant? quality?)
    2. Which image you chose and WHY
    3. The exact URL of your chosen image
    4. Which layout from the 20-layout table you will use

    Then call create_post_image_gemini with the chosen URL.

    Args:
        image_urls: All image URLs returned by fetch_images_exa (pass all of them).

    Returns:
        Multimodal content with visual thumbnails of all downloaded images.
